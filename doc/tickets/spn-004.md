we need to specify what executables an spn package defines. it's in `[[bin]]`, but there are test binaries too. not all of them should get exported. plan: mark exported binaries with `tool = true`. i.e. just another field on the `[[bin]]`
- find the package (`spn tool install $arg`, $arg could be a package in the index or a dir that has spn.toml)
- add it as a dependency to `~/.local/share/spn/tools/spn.toml`
- build by (for now) shelling out with `spn build $package` in the tools dir
- set up files in tool cache
  - index package => symlink
  - local package => copy
  - local editable => symlink
