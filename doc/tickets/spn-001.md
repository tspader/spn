what's the best way to test this? maybe find a dep that's easy-ish to build, but fails to build with tcc? or maybe it's just best to build with a musl toolchain and verify that it has no deps on glibc?

what about -static? this can all go really deep.
- verify with readelf or something that no resulting binaries reference dlopen?
- force deps to build statically/source? or just error?
- just mark libraries as "compatible with static libc linkage"?
