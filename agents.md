# Project Overview
- **spn**: Package manager and build tool for C projects in the style of UV or cargo (spn.toml + spn.c)
- written in modern C
  - `sp.h` instead of C standard library
  - x macro enums
  - `sp_ht` and `sp_da` macro-codegen'd hash table / dyn array
- core files:
  - `source/spn.c` is the entire implementation
  - `include/spn/spn.h` for public API used in packages
  - `spn.toml` is the package for spn itself; (downstream example)
  - `packages/sp/spn.toml` is the package for `sp.h` (source-only example)
  - `packages/tcc/spn.toml` is the package for `tcc` (compiled example)
- always use the `sp.h` skill (either with your `Skill` tool or with `./doc/llm/sp/SKILL.md`)
- never free allocated memory; we intentionally leak
- build with `make`, don't run it or write unit tests
- if you get build errors for missing headers/deps, stop and ask me to fix it
