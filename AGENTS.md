# overview
`spn` is a package manager and build tool for C projects in the style of UV or cargo. Key features:
- Projects are defined in TOML manifests (e.g. `./spn.toml`)
- Build scripts are written in plain C and compiled to WASM
- `spn` is written in C using `sp.h` as its custom standard library

# building
We keep two builds; a CMake-based build for building from scratch, and a self hosted build. The CMake build is wrapped with a tiny Makefile, just for coordination rather than build logic:

```
make
```

The self hosted build is a normal `spn` invocation:

```
spn build
```

# tests

@assets/llm/test.md

# compilation
- `$module/types.h` is ONLY types, and can be included liberally
- any other header in `$module/` is for functions.
  - if a TU includes such a header, you must either link to its impl in a unit test or mock it
  - you CANNOT include these headers in a `types.h`

## Rules
- Never, ever comment your code. Code with newly added comments will be rejected. If you're reviewing code, flag comments.
- Always use unprefixed names for private, static functions (e.g. `is_file_clean()` instead of `spn_is_file_clean()`)
- Always use `sp_cstr_as_str()` instead of `sp_str_view()`
- always use sp_zero instead of leaving variables uninitialized
- always use braces for one liner scopes (e.g. `for`, `if`)
- always use `foo()` instead of `foo(void)` for no-argument functions
- always use `sp_for(it, 5)` instead of `for (u32 it = 0; it < 5; it++)`
- always use `it` as your iterator variable (not e.g. `i`)
- always use the `sp_da` alias of `sp_dyn_array`
- always use `lower_snake` macros, regardless of surrounding code
- always use `spn_err_t` as the return type of a function which can fail; errors are returned up the call stack, go-style
  - prefer the `spn_try(expr)` family of macros for a zig-style try instead of `err = expr; if (err) { return err; }`
- prefer `const c8*` for structs or functions that are mostly used with literals, even if you convert to sp_str_t immediately when using
- prefer designated initializers to memberwise assignment
- prefer to use a specific allocator instead of the general purpose global allocator:
  - a memory arena (several in the codebase)
  - string interner (on global spn_ctx_t)
  - scratch arena, if transient (see: sp.h docs)
- prefer to use inner structs rather then lexical prefix (e.g. `foo.bar`, `foo.baz` instead of `foo_bar` and `foo_baz`)
- prefer `sp_io_write_new_line()` or `sp_io_write_line()` to `sp_io_write_str("\n")`
- prefer one word names for directories and file names
- never re-zero memory returned by sp_alloc()
- never use the C standard library. always use `sp.h`
- never ever use SP_UNUSED() or mark unused arguments in any way. just ignore them.
- never allocate and free individual allocations; every allocation should be tied to some kind of bulk allocation (e.g. an arena) and freed alongside
- never comment your code, under any circumstances
  - a single explanatory comment per test case is permissible if such comments exist on other tests in file
- never name out parameters "out"; name them as you normally would
