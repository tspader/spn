- quickjs needs to do an out of source build
- sodium technically is out of source, just run autoconf? is this ok?

# debug vs release
- quickjs
- sqlite
- sodium
- treesitter
- luajit

# static vs shared
- quickjs (think you can do shared out of the box?)
- treesitter ("make static" and "make shared")
- luajit BUILDMODE
